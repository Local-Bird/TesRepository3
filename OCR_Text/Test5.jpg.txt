Jagannath, whom we haye met euslier in Narottam’s inspired portrait
skeich (fig. HI), was Ghasiram’s partner until his premature death (at
perhaps 40 years of age). Their fathers were brothers, making the
relationship between the two men particularly close in Indian kinship

According to family lore, the cousins had very different artistic
sonalities. Jagannath was a slow, meticulons painter who specialised
in fine detailed passages, while his elder cousin worked with rapidity
and bravura (this is what Gulabji meant when he maryelled at
Ghasiram's “line force”). Together, they must have made a formidable
pair Jagannath’s grandson Revashankar (one of Nathadwara’s finest
living artists; se fig. 227 for a recent work) explained that Ghasiram, a§
the senior partner, would have directed the projects on which they
collaborated and, as a mark of respect, Jagannath might often have
signed Ghasirarn’s name to their cooperative paintings.!*
