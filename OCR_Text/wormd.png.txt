In other early works the God of Tiruvalavay is generally
referred to as Sckkar or Sokkangtha, while the term Sundaregvara
isfound in later works. Even in Jesuit letters the temple is caliec the
Cokkanatha Temple. Goddess Minaksi isreferred to as Angayark-
kannammai in early works. Mediaeval epigraphs from the Madura?
temple mention the Tirukkamakkottattu Aludaiya Nacciyar. This
is apparently a reference to Goddess Minaksi.

It is only in more recent times that the tempiehas come to be
popularly known as the Minaksi-Sundaregvara temple or even. more
briefly as Minaksitemple. This does not, however, mean that
Minaksi Amman came into prominence only in recent times. The
very legendary origin of the temple is based on Minaksi’s rule
and the marriage of Minaksi and Sundaresvara.

From available literary and inscriptional references one may
conclude that the temple has enjoyed a continuous existence almost
from the beginning of the Christian era, though, of course, restored,
repaired and extended bythe several rulers of the country.

The temple has gone through many vicissitudes. It was de.
spoiled by Muhammadans durirg Malik Kafur’s invasion in 1310
A.D. and again later during the Sultanate pericd when much
jhavoc was done. On a third occasion the Muhammadans
occupied the temple itself.

These raids and destructions caused the disappearance of many
of the older parts of the temple. When the temple came to be
rebuilt in between the raids and finally after the restoration of
Hindu monarchy after about 1370 A.D., that is, about the end ofthe
14th century A.D., it was almost entirely a new structure, though
the old and the new got mixed up in several places in the temple
complex. This isevident when one examinesin detail carefully tLe
several mandaas, corridors and shrines. One could easily see the
‘great mix-up that has taken place. This was perhaps due to the fact
that the people who restored or built anew, found many ofthe relics
of Muslim vandalism handy enough to be used asthey were. This
jed to different styles of pillars and other architectural features
being used ir a single structure.

It is usualto say that the Madurai temple is largely built at
one time and is, therefore, typical of the architectural style of the
