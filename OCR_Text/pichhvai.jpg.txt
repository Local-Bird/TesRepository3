PICHAVAI

The elaborate and ever-changing shringaras of
Shrinathji are supplemented by the imaginative use
of saja, decorative elements, including furnishings
and accessories. Among these are a set of textiles,
each with its name indicating the purpose. They
include pieces for the simhasana, the deity’s throne;
siri, the steps leading up to the throne; chauki, the
low stool placed near simhasana; pata, a platform:
khandpata, a low table; thada vastra, cloth covering
the stele; and pichhvai, the backdrop of the image.
Also used occasionally are chandovas, canopies,
suspended over the image; and divalgiris hung on the
walls. These textiles, to a large extent, contribute to
the rich and elegant atmosphere of Pushti Marga
shrines. The pichhvai, though, holds a special place
amongst the textiles adorning the shrines, and serves
to emphasize the theme of a shringara and to express
the mood of the season, the festival or the occasion.

The pichhvais are produced in many ways and by
various techniques — they are painted, printed,
woven, appliqued, brocaded, studded with mirrors
and embroidered with pearls or semi-precious stones,
or sequins. They may even consist of net needlework!

While all Pushti Marga shrines use pichhvais, those
for the shrine of Shrinathji usually are the biggest,
about 3.0 m. wide and 1.8m. high. The portion
which comes just behind the icon is left either blank
