The two other centres within the Mughal dominions which are frequently
mentioned in contemporary trade records as centres of fine cotton-painting are Sironj,
in Tonk State, and Agra, In 1614, the English merchant Offlet reported that the best
Sironj ‘Pintathoes’ cost one rupee per yard at source?’—an extremely high price for
those times, applicable only to the finest work. In 1630 Mundy wrote that the
“excellent Pintadoes or Chintz of Sironj were esteemed throughout India as “next in
gootiness to those of Masulipatam”;" and similarly, in 1666, de Thévenot described the
toiles peintes of Sironj as ‘coming near in beauty” to those of the Coromandel Coast."'

The evidence of fine cotton-paintings being made at Agra is again derived from

East India Company’trade records. “Of cheetes or pintadoes the best and greatest
quantities are to be had at Agra”, wrote the Surat factors in 1618." In 1634, William
Fremlin, writing from Agra itself, mentioned specifically that there were cloths in the
area “stayned after the forme of the fine paintings of Masulipatam”," At the present
stage of'our knowledge it is not possible to identify with certainty the cotton-paintings
which came from either Agra or Sironj. The French trader Georges Roques, travelling
in 1678, found the country around Sironj much troubled by marauders, due to poli-
tical disturbances between the Mughal emperor and one of his vassals. The trade-
caravans en route for Agra were constantly being pillaged, and Roques stated that
while the trouble lasted they were taking a route via Ahmedabad and the west. This
temporary change in the trade-route would, of course, also have affected Burhanpur,
even if the country were not actively disturbed there; Roques had noted a decline of
the trade in that city, earlier in his journey."

‘The East India Company also had a factory at Lahore. Records are less
frequent, hecause the extent of trade was smaller from that area, due partly to its
distance from the ports, but mainly because the quality of both fabric and workmanship
was considered too coarse for European taste of the seventeenth and eighteenth cen-
turics, In the nineteenth century, Lahore was one of the largest centres of hand-block
printing in India, and the craft remains alive today. The main products of this later
period were floorspreads and hangings of thick cotton, It can be assumed that the same
type of work was done in earlier periods, because the cotton plant of the Panjab yields
a strong coarse fibre, and also because the colder winter makes fine cotton and muslin
impracticable for clothing for the greater part of the year. However, nineteenth century
records from all parts of India also show that craftsmen migrated long distances, at

Periods of political or economic upheaval, to seek more profitable patronage.
