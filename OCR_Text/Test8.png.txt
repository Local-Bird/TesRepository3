For the last 20 years or so, artists’ books have bid for mainstream status in
the arts. Artists’ books define a very specific zone of activity in terms of
communication—one that has a relation to independent publishing, fine
arts printmaking, and traditional book crafts, but which cannot be com-
fortably contained within the conceptual parameters of any of these
fields. In spite of historical links to older traditions, artists’ books belong
more precisely to the diverse field of art activity that characterizes late-
20th-century innovations.

Though artists’ books have proliferated, the current hype is that books
are about to be an extinct species, along the lines of typewriters, carbon
paper, and other instruments and products of outmoded technology.
Though it is begrudgingly granted that books will continue to exist as a
novelty, the bulk of cultural forecasters seem determined to will the book
as such out of existence. Only kinky fetishists or the electronically disen-
franchised will continue to think of books as elements of their daily life,
while the rest of us, it is foretold, are condemned to snuggle up at night
to electronic screens, keep our secret diaries on fuzzy-thinking notepads,
and read endlessly mutating hypertext off a pixilated monitor.
