The following section continies Kapila’s extended discourse with his
mother, Devahiti. Here Kapila offers an overview of “object-meditational”
yoga practice (sabija-yoga), where the object to be meditated upon is the
form of Vishnu as a whole and as so many particular features of his bodily
form. The emphasis here is on visualization of divine form and hence
divine personhood; but in the concluding verses the theme of yogic prac-
tice aiming at yogic perfection suggests, with some ambiguity, a leaning
toward “impersonal” realization of ultimate reality as formless. Still, the
chapter returns to an ultimate distinction between the individual self and
the supreme self.
