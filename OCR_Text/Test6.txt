the right of individual existence. Is architectural expression was a style
that differed from the superabundant style of the followers of the
Brahma by its sobriety. Like Christianity, Buddhism was of a cosmo-
politan inclination, and even though it spread over the whole of east
‘Asia, it could not last long under the intoxicating sky of India.

“The Brahmins followed the opposite way. By erecting barriers they
tried to channel these truly invincible forces into a definite direction
with the result that they were partly diverted and rendered harmless,
partly even converted into powerful driving forces for the state mecha-
nism. For example, instead of combating the consciousness of the
nothingness of the Self in living nature, the Brahmins encouraged the
people to submit to it, thereby disdaining the lever of personal ambi-
tion so powerful in other countries. The monumental expression of
this principle of government pursued by the Brahmins are those tem-
ples, pagodas, cloisters, and pilgrim hostels: sometimes constructed in
stone, sometimes hewn out of rock, sometimes sunk into the bowels
of the earth, all with profuse, plantlike, and involved ornamentation.
‘Their purpose was only the prop, as it were, the pretext for such
‘ornamentation! These works created by myriads of penitants and
monks were self-mortfication perpetuated in stone and at the same
time a mortification of the stone. And this abundance of visually
bewildering forms that seemingly disdained any law was, in fact,
prescribed down to the smallest detail and reduced to rules by the holy
books of the Silpa Sastras, the divine, Brahmanic law book on architec
ture. Through those amazing creations the self-tormenting fanaticism
of the Hindu people, which otherwise would have remained sterile,

itself enormously productive ~ again a triumphal monument to
the statesmanlike wisdom!

Egypt was also a society that in prehistoric times was probably consti-
tuted on a warlike basis, and the oldest architecture of the country is
consistent with these conditions. At least this seems to be indicated by
the pyramids, so closely related to the terraced towers of the Asians,
and by other observations on the art and the constitution of the Old
Kingdom.

But a long period of security from outside attacks may have given
society the time to adapt to the soil and, as it were, take roots. The idea
of autochthony became ingrained with the Egyptian people and was the
basis for the ruling system of a landed aristocracy that guided the des
tiny of Egypt under the dominance of theocratic forms through thou
sands of years.
