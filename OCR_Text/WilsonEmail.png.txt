Dear Professor Wilson,

First off, thank you so much for your detailed comments regarding my final paper! They were very
helpful in thinking about my affect theory argument and identifying what worked as opposed to
what didnt. | was curious if there was a way to resolve these tensions, so I went back to A Study
in Scarlet and prodded further at the scene in question. I think | might\ve found a way to rework the
argument that better connects the two sections of my paper, so | was wondering if| could run it by
you?

If you dont mind Ill send you a more detailed summary later, but in brief, Gregson and Lestrade
actually mirror the probable affective response of the reader as they watch “with considerable
curiosity and some contempt,” which Watson rejects in favor of a more intimate understanding of
Holmes which he “had begun to realize.” In doing so, Watson leverages the affective response to
further alienate Holmes from the “ordinary understanding” while clueing in the reader on his newly
found, uniquely intimate awareness of Holmes’ methods that only he and the reader possess. In
the scene immediately afterwards, Watson reacts to Holmes’ collection of “frst hand evidence”
with the exclamation, "you amaze me, Holmes,” utilizing the reader-response guide rails to
reconfigure the affective response into one of amazement, which not only illustrates interaction
between the two critical frameworks, but resolves the thematic tension between the two
responses.
